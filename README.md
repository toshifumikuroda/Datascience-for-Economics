The lecture is made for 4 day summer school.
Day1 : Lecture on dplyr, ggplot, and timeseries (day 1-1  COVID-19 in Japan, day 1-2 Philips curve in Japan).
Day2 : Lecture on demand estimation
1. day 2-1 : Monte carlo simulation of identification of demand and supply functon
2. day 2-2: Monte carlo of power analysis, day 2-3: demand estimation by using field experiments by reproducting Karlan and List(2007)).
Day3 : lecture on supply estimation
1. day 3-2 : Use estimatr to estimate the fixed effect model and clusterd robust standard error
2. day 3-3 : production function estimation by reproducing Bloom and Reenen (2007)).
Day4 : Lecture on identifycation of comparative statistics (some people say treatment evaluation)
1. day 4-2 : use Synth to conduct synthetic control methond
2. day 4-3 : comparative statistics by reproducting Acemoglu et al. (2001)).
